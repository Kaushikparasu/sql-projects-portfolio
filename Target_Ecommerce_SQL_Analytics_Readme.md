## üéØ Project Objective

To analyze Target‚Äôs e-commerce performance across **customers, products, regions, and delivery efficiency** using advanced SQL techniques.  
The goal is to build a reusable SQL data model (via views) and extract key business insights that help leadership understand:
- Growth trends over time  
- Customer retention & churn  
- Product category performance  
- Regional delivery efficiency

## üß© Datasets Used

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `orders.csv` | Order-level data including timestamps & status |
| `order_items.csv` | Item-level data including price & seller |
| `products.csv` | Product catalog with category information |
| `payments.csv` | Transaction details (payment type & value) |
| `customers.csv` | Customer demographics (city/state) |
| `sellers.csv` | Seller-level identifiers |

## üèóÔ∏è Data Model (Analytical Views)

A modular set of **SQL Views** was created to organize the pipeline:

| View | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **`v_order_payments`** | Aggregates payment values per order |
| **`v_customer_orders`** | Links customer details to orders |
| **`v_city_revenue`** | Calculates total revenue & contribution by city |
| **`v_customer_frequency`** | Counts total orders per customer |
| **`v_qoq_growth`** | Computes quarter-over-quarter order & revenue growth |
| **`v_customer_churn`** | Identifies customers who didn‚Äôt reorder in the next quarter |
| **`customer_order_dates_city`** | Combines delivery timestamps with region info |
| **`v_average_delivery_times`** | Measures delivery efficiency across regions |
| *(CTE)* **`prod_cate_price`** | Calculates Average Order Value (AOV) per category |

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- **Joins:** INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN across 5+ tables  
- **Window Functions:** `LAG()`, `AVG() OVER()`, `COUNT() OVER()`  
- **Aggregations:** `SUM()`, `ROUND()`, `DATEDIFF()`  
- **CTEs & Views:** Modular query design for reusability  
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE WHEN`, `HAVING` filters  
- **Performance Filters:** Excluded canceled / unavailable orders  
- **Business-Driven Filters:** Included only meaningful data points (> 50 orders per city)

## üß† Key Insights

1. **Quarter-over-Quarter Growth:** Orders grew steadily year-over-year with consistent revenue expansion.  
2. **Top Revenue Cities:** S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro contribute > 20% of total revenue.  
3. **Customer Retention:** ~95% of customers are one-time buyers ‚Üí acquisition heavy model.  
4. **Average Order Value (AOV):** Pc's has the highest AOV (~‚Çπ1,200), House-Comfort lowest (~‚Çπ31).  
5. **Churn Rate:** Around 95-98% customers fail to reorder in the next quarter.  
6. **Delivery Insights:**  
   - Nationwide average delivery time ‚âà 12 days  
   - Northern regions (AM, RR) take 4‚Äì5 days longer than average  
   - Southern regions (SP, PR) deliver 2 days faster on average
